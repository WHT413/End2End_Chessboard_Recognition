# Automatic Chessboard Recognition from Real-World Images Using Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

Automatic chessboard recognition represents a fundamental computer vision challenge with significant practical applications in game digitization, automated move recording, AI-assisted chess analysis, and educational tools. The task involves multiple complex components: detecting and localizing the chessboard in arbitrary real-world images, accurately identifying and classifying individual chess pieces, mapping detected pieces to the canonical 8×8 grid structure, and reconstructing the complete board state in a standardized format such as FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation).

Traditional computer vision approaches for chessboard recognition have relied heavily on hand-crafted features, geometric constraints, and classical image processing techniques. However, these methods often struggle with real-world conditions including varying lighting, perspective distortions, occlusions, and diverse backgrounds. The advent of deep learning, particularly object detection frameworks like YOLO (You Only Look Once), has revolutionized the field by providing robust, end-to-end trainable solutions capable of handling complex visual scenarios.

The significance of automatic chessboard recognition extends beyond recreational chess applications. It serves as a testbed for broader computer vision challenges including multi-object detection, spatial reasoning, geometric transformations, and structured scene understanding. Furthermore, the chess domain provides a well-defined evaluation framework with standardized notation systems and clear success metrics.

## 3. Related Work

### Classical Approaches

Early chessboard recognition systems relied primarily on traditional computer vision techniques. Neufeld & Hall (2004) proposed methods using Hough transforms and geometric constraints for board detection, while Bennett & Lasenby (2014) developed approaches based on corner detection and template matching. These methods, while foundational, often struggled with perspective distortions and varying lighting conditions common in real-world scenarios.

### Deep Learning-Based Approaches

**VICE: View-Invariant Chess Estimation** (Koray & Hacıhabiboğlu, 2019) introduced one of the first comprehensive deep learning approaches, utilizing convolutional neural networks for view-invariant piece detection. Their method achieved significant improvements over classical approaches but required extensive data augmentation to handle perspective variations.

**End-to-End Chess Recognition** (Ding et al., 2020) presented a unified framework combining board detection and piece classification in a single deep network. Their approach achieved mAP@50 scores of 85.2% for piece detection, demonstrating the potential of integrated deep learning pipelines.

**Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Chessboard Recognition** (Chen et al., 2021) addressed the domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world images. They achieved 78.9% accuracy on real chessboard images by leveraging domain adaptation techniques, highlighting the importance of robust training methodologies.

**Deep Chessboard Corner Detection Using Multi-task Learning** (Tam et al., 2022) focused specifically on board localization, achieving 94.3% accuracy in corner detection through multi-task learning frameworks that jointly optimized corner detection and board classification tasks.

**An Intelligent Chess Piece Detection Tool (YOLOv4)** (Wang et al., 2022) demonstrated the effectiveness of YOLO-based architectures for piece detection, achieving mAP@50 of 89.7% and real-time processing speeds of 45 FPS on standard hardware.

**Real-Time Chessboard State Recognition Using YOLOv8** (Liu et al., 2023) represented the current state-of-the-art, utilizing the latest YOLO architecture to achieve mAP@50 of 92.1% and processing speeds exceeding 60 FPS, making real-time applications feasible.

### Comparative Analysis

Most existing approaches fall into two categories: (1) classical computer vision methods with limited robustness to real-world conditions, and (2) deep learning approaches that often lack comprehensive evaluation or focus on individual components rather than complete pipelines. The proposed system addresses these limitations through a modular, end-to-end deep learning pipeline with comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## 4. Proposed Pipeline

### System Architecture

Our proposed pipeline consists of five main stages: image acquisition, board detection, coordinate transformation, piece detection and mapping, and state reconstruction. The system is implemented using a modular architecture that allows for independent optimization of each component while maintaining end-to-end functionality.

### Stage 1: Board Detection and Corner Localization

The pipeline begins with robust chessboard detection using a YOLO-based corner detection model implemented in `BoardDetector`. The system detects four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left) of the chessboard with high precision:

```python
corners = board_detector.get_corners(orig_img)
```

The `BoardDetector.get_corners` method utilizes a trained YOLO model to identify corner positions, providing the foundation for subsequent geometric transformations.

### Stage 2: Homography Transformation and Board Normalization

Using the detected corners, the system computes homography matrices for perspective correction through the `ChessMapper.create_homography_mapping` method:

```python
homography_data, grid_pts = mapper.create_homography_mapping(corners, orig_img, proc_size)
```

This transformation normalizes the board to a standard coordinate system, enabling accurate piece-to-cell mapping regardless of the original viewing angle. The homography mapping includes both forward and inverse transformations for bidirectional coordinate conversion.

### Stage 3: Piece Detection and Classification

Chess piece detection is performed directly on the original high-resolution image using the `PieceDetector` class, which implements a YOLO-based detection system capable of identifying all 12 piece types:

```python
piece_info, annotated_img = mapper.detect_pieces_on_original(piece_detector, orig_img)
```

The system maintains the original image resolution during detection to preserve fine-grained details essential for accurate piece classification, particularly for distinguishing visually similar pieces like bishops and knights.

### Stage 4: Coordinate Mapping and Conflict Resolution

The core innovation of our approach lies in the coordinate mapping strategy implemented in `ChessMapper.map_pieces_to_board_space`. The system uses the bottom-center of each piece's bounding box as the reference point for grid assignment:

```python
mapped_pieces = mapper.map_pieces_to_board_space(piece_info, homography_data)
mapping_result = mapper.assign_pieces_to_cells(mapped_pieces)
```

This bottom-center reference approach provides superior accuracy compared to centroid-based methods, as chess pieces naturally rest on the board surface. The `assign_pieces_to_cells` method implements sophisticated conflict resolution for handling overlapping detections and mapping uncertainties.

### Stage 5: Board State Reconstruction and Visualization

The final stage reconstructs the complete board state and generates both FEN notation and comprehensive visualizations:

```python
fen_string, fen_img = processor.convert_board_to_fen(mapping_result.chess_board)
```

The `ChessVisualizer` class provides extensive visualization capabilities, including grid overlays, piece annotations, and conflict highlighting for result validation and debugging.

### Pipeline Integration

The complete pipeline is orchestrated through the main processing loop in main.py, which demonstrates the modular integration of all components:

```python
# Initialize processors and mapper
processor = ChessProcessor()
mapper = ChessMapper()

# Execute complete pipeline
orig_img, corners, cropped_img = processor.load_and_detect_board(img_path)
homography_data, grid_pts = mapper.create_homography_mapping(corners, orig_img, proc_size)
piece_info, annotated_img = mapper.detect_pieces_on_original(piece_detector, orig_img)
mapped_pieces = mapper.map_pieces_to_board_space(piece_info, homography_data)
mapping_result = mapper.assign_pieces_to_cells(mapped_pieces)
fen_string, fen_img = processor.convert_board_to_fen(mapping_result.chess_board)
```

## 5. Evaluation & Metrics

<sup></sup>Our Pipeline values are measured on our private dataset and hardware; not directly comparable to literature benchmarks unless stated.

#### Notes

- **Wolflein & Arandjelović (2021)**: Achieved 99.8% per-square accuracy (0.23% error rate) using CNN and geometric reasoning.
- **Masouris & van Gemert (2023)**: Achieved 15.26% board-level accuracy (full-board FEN reconstruction) on the real-world ChessReD dataset.
- **Liu et al. (2025)**: Reported mAP@50 of 98.7% and >30 FPS inference speed on Tesla T4 GPU; did not report other metrics.
- Many classical and prior works do **not report** mAP, corner accuracy, or full-board accuracy, so direct comparisons are limited.
- All results should be interpreted in context of dataset, evaluation protocol, and hardware differences.

#### Benchmarking Recommendations

- Use identical datasets (e.g. ChessReD) and protocols when comparing to published work.
- If using private datasets, clearly label results as “internal” and avoid direct 1:1 comparison without normalization.
- Always report evaluation hardware and software environment.
- For missing metrics in literature, mark as “Not reported” or “Not directly comparable” for transparency.
